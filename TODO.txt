# This aspects have to be incorporated in future versions of cgn to make it less embarassing.

BEFORE PUBLICATION

- Interface should only depend on scipy-linear operator, use RegularizationOperator only internally.

- Edit .gitignore to make sure that only the relevant files (no cache, log, etc) are in git.

- Write the README
	1. Write installation guide (should be easy).
	2. Write tutorial.


AFTER PUBLICATION (in order of urgency)

- Ensure that CGN satisfies SOLID.

- Write a problem template, so that the user knows how to use cgn and basically only has to fill in his stuff.

- Put default parameters in separate file.

- Write a ReadTheDocs
