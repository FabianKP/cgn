# This aspects have to be incorporated in future versions of cgn to make it less embarassing.


- There should be a way to remove constraints from cgn.Problem instances.

- There should be an easier way to modify the regularization. If I want to change, say, a regularization parameter, I currently have to call .set_regularization and provide the old mean and regularization operator. This should be easier.

- Make the properties of cgn.Problem more intuitive. For example, cgn.Problem.fun does not return the misfit function but the misfit function scaled by alpha and the noise regularization operator.

- Remove dependencies by implementing subroutines yourself (in C++).
