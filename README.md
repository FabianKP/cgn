CGN
============

**CGN** stands for "Constrained Gauss-Newton method".
This package contains a **Python** implementation of the Gauss-Newton method for nonlinear least-squares
problems with linear constraints. That is, CGN provides a method for solving constrained optimization
problems of the form

Such problems arise frequently in maximum likelihood estimation or in Bayesian maximum-a-posteriori estimation with 
Gaussian priors.

Installation
============

The [Installation Guide](https://fabiankp.github.io/cgn/installation.html) explains how the ``cgn`` package can be 
installed.

Usage
=====

For some simple end-to-end use cases, see the [Examples](https://github.com/FabianKP/cgn/tree/main/examples). For a 
more detailed explanation of the interface to ``cgn``, see the [Tutorial](https://fabiankp.github.io/cgn/tutorial.html). 
If you want to apply ``cgn``, you might find it useful to start with the pre-defined 
[Template](https://fabiankp.github.io/cgn/tutorial.html#template), and adapt it according to your needs.

For full details on the individual classes 
and functions provided by ``cgn``, please refer to the [Documentation](https://fabiankp.github.io/cgn/).
